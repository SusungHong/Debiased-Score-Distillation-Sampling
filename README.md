# Debiasing Scores and Prompts of 2D Diffusion for Robust Text-to-3D Generation (D-SDS)

Welcome to the official and practical implementation of the [Debiasing Score Distillation Sampling (D-SDS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15413).

## üé≠ Why Choose D-SDS?

D-SDS offers a solution when SDS methods, such as DreamFusion, Magic3D, SJC, etc., don't produce the 3D results you're aiming for. If you've faced issues with artifacts or multiple faces, D-SDS is designed to overcome these challenges through two key mechanisms: Score Debiasing and Prompt Debiasing. For a comprehensive understanding of these processes, we recommend delving into our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15413).

Below are the results with D-SDS on ThreeStudio implementation of DreamFusion:

## üêß Using D-SDS

Incorporating D-SDS into your work is a straightforward process, particularly with our score-debiasing feature that facilitates static and dynamic clipping of 2D-to-3D scores.

A highly commendable project, [ThreeStudio](https://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio), has already integrated our method in its main branch. To utilize it, you can adjust the setting `system.guidance.grad_clip=[0,0.5,2.0,10000]` while using DeepFloyd-IF for guidance. For example:
```
# Sample with score debiasing
python launch.py --config configs/dreamfusion-if.yaml --train --gpu 0 system.prompt_processor.prompt="a colorful toucan with a large beak" system.guidance.grad_clip=[0,0.5,2.0,10000]
```

For [SJC](https://github.com/pals-ttic/sjc), simply clone the original repository and adjust the setting `/path/to/sjc/run_sjc.py` to ours.

We're currently undertaking code refactoring for prompt debiasing (employing BERT-like LMs to identify contradictions) and will be releasing this updated codebase soon!
